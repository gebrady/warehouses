### This set of folders contains files and scripts used to interpret parcel data from two California counties.
To view the script used to create the map featured in the Los Angeles Times, access the Jupyter Notebook "warehouses.ipynb" in the main directory.

To interact with the sample ArcGIS Pro environment used to create the maps found in the Jupyter Notebook, [download](https://pitzer.box.com/s/i5c6nbo2vpuwdj76a25nm4dtzw1j1oxr) our .zip file containing the relevant files, directories, and scripts, as well as all maps we have produced using the workflow.

To view the maps, access the Maps directory after extracting.

To open the GIS environment the script operates in, access "IE_WarehouseGrowth.aprx" in the home directory of the extracted folder.
